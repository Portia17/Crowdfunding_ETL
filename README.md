# Crowdfunding_ETL
## Project 2: Nazeli Mnatsakanyan and Portia Pray

### In this project, we worked on creating and joining tables along with splitting existing tables and importing the CSVs we created into a database. <br/>

Completed code can be found at this link: https://github.com/Portia17/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/main/Starter_Files/ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code.ipynb <br/>
Our seperate contributions can be found in the Starter_Files folder under our names. <br/> <br/>
Link to our ERD with the image of our QuickDBD code is here: https://github.com/Portia17/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/main/ERD.png <br/> <br/>
Proof of the CSVs being successfully read into Postgres is here: https://github.com/Portia17/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/main/proof_of_DB_imports.png <br/> <br/>
All created CSV files and links to the initial xlsx files can be found in our Resources folder within the Starter_Files: https://github.com/Portia17/Crowdfunding_ETL/tree/main/Starter_Files/Resources <br/> <br/>
The export file from QuickDBD we used to create the tables in Postgres can be found in our Resources folder in Starter_Files or linked here: https://github.com/Portia17/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/main/Starter_Files/Resources/crowdfunding_db_schema.sql <br/> <br/>
